# README for First-Year Statistics Curriculum Analysis at NotReal University

## Introduction

This repository hosts the analysis for a project undertaken by NotReal University, aimed at enhancing the first-year statistics curriculum to boost graduation rates within 
the major. The analysis focuses on examining pass rates across different courses to identify areas for improvement in the curriculum.

## Study Overview

The project's objective is to conduct a detailed analysis of the pass rates for each first-year statistics course, providing insights into student success rates on their 
first attempt. This analysis is a critical step in evaluating and subsequently refining the curriculum to improve educational outcomes for students.

## Key Findings

- The cumulative pass rate across all examined classes is alarmingly low at 18.13%.
- Individual course pass rates vary significantly, with Intro to Probability leading at an 80% pass rate, followed by Biology at 76.67%, Intro to Statistics at
-  70%, ELA 101 at 66.67%, and History at 63.33%.
- The overall pass rate of 18.13% is substantially lower than the individual course pass rates, suggesting a discrepancy in the calculation of the cumulative pass rate.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- There is a clear need to reassess the method used for calculating the overall pass rate to ensure its accuracy.
- Understanding the disparities in pass rates among courses will guide targeted interventions to improve the curriculum and student success rates.

## Future Directions

The insights from this analysis will inform curriculum adjustments in the first-year statistics program. Ongoing evaluation will be essential to measure the 
impact of these changes on student success rates.
